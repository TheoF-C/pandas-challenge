# pandas-challenge

## HeroesOfPymoli

The goal if this project is to analyze a csv file containing items which were purchased within the Heroes of Pymoli game with respective player data. Using Pandas, we are able to find statistics about player demographics, popular items, etc.

## PyCitySchools

This project uses two csv files, one with individual student data and scores, and other file with data on the high schools these students attend. By using these two files in conjunction with Pandas we can find the best and worst performing schools, as well as many statistics about student scores.
